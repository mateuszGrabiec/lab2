        <strong>Rock, paper, scissors</strong> is a project which helps me to learn about real-time web applications. Part of the code comes from 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVcVbCLmKew" style="color: skyblue">here.</a> This tutorial was of valuable assistance. Especially as I didn't know node.js at all. 
        I chose this tool because I would have to refresh all clients' sites periodically in PHP enviroment. The app is based on sockets.
        My next goal is to add rankings, play with friends etc.

      <p><strong>Checkers</strong> was written to get a pass from methodology of programming. Our task was to write a simple game. 
        The funny thing is that I didn't know the rules of this game. So implementing some of them was quite a hard task.
        I'm beginner in graphics so white pawns is "o"/"@" and black is "x"/"X". The pogramme is based on WPF, language applied is C#. WSIWYG in 
        visual studio was a very helpful tool when I was creating the menu. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to programme a saving game function
        because the deadline was close and when I finished I started work on new projects.

        <p><strong>Hangman</strong>, in this game we have to guess a word which was invented by another person. Unlike other projects 
          a huge part comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVtiJHFCSU" style="color: skyblue">a tutorial.</a> I wrote the
          category function and made this game responsive, so you can play it on your mobile phone. Writing this game helped me
          to understand Java Script.
